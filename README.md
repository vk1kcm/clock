# clock
A simple, clean, browser based web clock

This is a modification of the web clock published at;

https://www.nayuki.io/page/full-screen-clock-javascript

I've added the date and used the Airbus B612 font for readability.

The clock uses the local time of your computer.  If your computer clock is wrong, then so
will this clock be wrong.  If you want to use this clock then make sure your computer
is synchronised with a reliable time source.
